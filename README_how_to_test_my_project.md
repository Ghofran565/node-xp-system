# How to Test the Real-time Leaderboard Backend Project

This document explains the various ways to test this specific project, a Node.js-based system with MongoDB, Redis, and Socket.io, designed for task/XP management, tournaments, and real-time leaderboards. These testing methods ensure functionality, performance, security, and reliability, updated as of **Tuesday, September 16, 2025, at 10:37 AM CEST**.

## Testing Methods

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Description**: Unit testing focuses on verifying the correctness of individual components, such as functions, methods, or modules, in isolation. For this project, it involves testing algorithms like XP calculation, task eligibility checks, or schema validations without involving external systems like databases or APIs.
- **Purpose**: Ensures each piece of code works as intended, making it easier to identify and fix bugs early.
- **Tools**: Jest, Mocha, Jasmine.
- **Relevance**: Critical for validating core logic (e.g., applying rank and group boosters) and maintaining code quality during development.

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Description**: Integration testing evaluates how different modules or services (e.g., controllers, database, Redis caching) interact with each other. It tests the flow of data between components, such as an API endpoint retrieving tasks from MongoDB or updating a leaderboard via Redis.
- **Purpose**: Confirms that integrated parts function together correctly, catching issues that unit tests might miss due to component interactions.
- **Tools**: Supertest, Jest.
- **Relevance**: Essential for ensuring seamless operation of APIs like `/api/tasks/assigned` or real-time updates with Socket.io.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Description**: E2E testing simulates real-world user scenarios across the entire application, from API calls to database updates and notifications. It tests complete workflows, such as a player registering, verifying their email, joining a tournament, and completing a task.
- **Purpose**: Validates the system from the user’s perspective, ensuring all layers (frontend if present, backend, database) work together as expected.
- **Tools**: Cypress, Playwright, Supertest.
- **Relevance**: Key for testing the full player experience, including email verification and real-time leaderboard updates, aligning with the project’s API testing phase.

### 4. Load and Performance Testing
- **Description**: Load and performance testing assesses how the system handles high traffic or concurrent users, simulating thousands of players completing tasks or viewing leaderboards simultaneously. It measures response times, throughput, and resource usage.
- **Purpose**: Ensures the application scales effectively and identifies bottlenecks under load, critical for real-time features.
- **Tools**: k6, Artillery, Locust.
- **Relevance**: Vital for the leaderboard’s real-time updates and tournament peak usage, ensuring Redis and MongoDB perform under pressure.

### 5. Security Testing
- **Description**: Security testing identifies vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized access, injection attacks, or weak authentication. It involves checking JWT validation, role-based access, and anti-cheat mechanisms like flagging suspicious XP gains.
- **Purpose**: Protects the system from exploits and ensures compliance with security requirements, a priority given the roadmap’s enhanced security focus.
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Snyk, Postman.
- **Relevance**: Crucial for safeguarding player data, tournament integrity, and admin operations.

### 6. Manual Testing
- **Description**: Manual testing involves human interaction to validate functionality that’s challenging to automate, such as verifying email delivery, checking UI (if integrated), or exploring edge cases. It often uses tools like Postman to send API requests and review responses.
- **Purpose**: Provides a human perspective to catch issues that automated tests might overlook, especially during initial development or post-deployment.
- **Tools**: Postman, curl.
- **Relevance**: Useful for validating email notifications and exploring new features during the API testing phase.

## Additional Notes
- These testing methods complement each other, covering different aspects of the project from code-level accuracy to system-wide reliability.
- The choice of method depends on the development phase, with unit and integration tests being foundational, and load, security, and E2E tests becoming prominent as the project matures toward deployment.
- The tools listed are widely used in Node.js environments and can be integrated with continuous integration systems for automated testing.
